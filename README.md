Here are my collection of solutions for the Daily Programming challenges posed at /r/dailyprogrammer. However, I want to focus on intermediate problems so it may not be Actually Daily In The Concrete.

Solutions are formatted as AAA-B where AAA is the challenge number and B is either e, i or h for easy, intermediate or hard respectively.
